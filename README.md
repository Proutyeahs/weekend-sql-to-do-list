# Project Name

TODO List

## Description

I created a todo list that saves tasks to the server. You are able to add new tasks and check off what tasks you have completed, as well as delete tasks you no longer need on the list.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
